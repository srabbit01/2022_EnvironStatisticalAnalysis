4-5. Suppose we have a random sample of size 2n from a
population denoted by X, and E(X)=u and V(X)=(시그마)^2.
X1bar = 1/2n씨그마(2n/i=1)Xi and X2bar = 1/n씨그마(n/i=1)Xi 
be two estimators of u. Which is the better estimator of u?
Explain your choice.

4-7. Suppose that 세타1 and 세타2 are unbiased estimators of the
parameter 세타. We know that V(세타1^)=2 and V(세타2^)=4 Which
estimator is better, and in what sense is it better?

4-9. Calculate the relative efficiency of the two estimators in
Exercise 4-7.

4-10. Suppose that 세타1^ and 세타2^ are estimators of the parameter
세타. We know that E(세타1^)=세타, E(세타2^)=세타/2, V(세타1^)=10,
V(세타2^)=4. Which estimator is “better”? In what sense is it
better?

4-12. Let three random samples of sizes n1=20, n2=10,
and n3=8 be taken from a population with mean u and variance
세타^2. Let (S^2)1, (S^2)2, and (S^2)3 be the sample variances. Show that
S^2=(20*(S^2)1+10*(S^2)2+8*(S^2)3)/38 is an unbiased estimator of 세타^2.

4-15. A textile fiber manufacturer is investigating a new
drapery yarn, which has a standard deviation of 0.3 kg. The
company wishes to test the hypothesis H0: u=14 against
H1: u<14, using a random sample of five specimens.
(a) What is the P-value if the sample average is Xbar=13.7kg?
(b) Find 베타 for the case where the true mean elongation force
is 13.5 kg and we assume that 알파=0.05.
(c) What is the power of the test from part (b)?
4-16. Repeat Exercise 4-15 using a sample size of n=16
and the same critical region.
'''

'''
4-17. In Exercise 4-15 with n=5:
(a) Find the boundary of the critical region if the type I error
probability is specified to be 알파=0.01.
(b) Find 베타 for the case when the true mean elongation force is 13.5 kg.
(c) What is the power of the test?

4-19. The heat evolved in calories per gram of a cement
mixture is approximately normally distributed. The mean is
thought to be 100 and the standard deviation is 2. We wish to
test H0: u=100 versus H1: u not= 100 with a sample of n=9 specimens.
(a) If the rejection region is defined as Xbar<98.5 or Xbar>101.5,
find the type I error probability 알파.
(b) Find 베타 for the case where the true mean heat evolved is 103.
(c) Find 베타  for the case where the true mean heat evolved is
105. This value of 베타 is smaller than the one found in part (b). Why?
