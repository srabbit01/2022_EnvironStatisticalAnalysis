6-1. Establishing the properties of materials is an important
problem in identifying a suitable substitute for biodegradable
materials in the fast-food packaging industry. Consider the
following data on product density (g/cm3) and thermal conductivity
K-factor (W/mK) published in Materials Research
and Innovation (1999, pp. 2–8).

6-4. Turbidity is a measure of the cloudiness of the water and
is used to indicate water quality levels. Higher turbidity levels
are usually associated with higher levels of disease- causing
microbes like viruses, bacteria, and parasites. The turbidity
units of measure are reported as formazin suspension units, or
FAUs. Data were collected on the Rio Grande River during the
late spring and summer months in order to study the relationship
between temperature and turbidity. The data follow.

Characteristics of Concrete: Intrinsic Permeability,” Vol. 41,
1989) presented data on compressive strength x and intrinsic
permeability y of various concrete mixes and cures. The following
